        - Install to all default setting
    - Conda is a package manager. It allows to create virtual environment
    - Ex: you can create as many virtual environment you want.

- What all these softwares are doing? 
    - Vizio Studio Code: Environment to write code
    - Git: Can connect to git hub. Can help pull changes
    - Conda: Helps to create virtual environments. To test the features

- Install packages 
    - Testing in Terminal
    - (base): 
    - conda hit enter, no error then it's good
    - ![Terminal Environment](image-2.png)
    - To check the environments, ```conda env list```
    - To create a new environment, ``` conda create  -n geo python ```
    - To activate a package, ```conda activate geo```
    - ![Virtual environment](image-3.png)
    - To install a new package, ```conda install - c conda - forge mamba```
    - To install a package from Git ```pip install git+ url```
    - To install package locally 
        - '''down zip, 
        - unzip the directory by extract all
        - project folder
        - go the files and click to open the Terminal, 
        - Or copy the path of the directory
        - Go to Terminate, having your conda directory activated
        - cd + paste the navigation
        - Next line type ``dir```
        - type ``` pip install .``` Period mean install from local computer

    - 02 variables data type
        - In this part you'll learn about the different kind of data you work with in your Python programs. You'll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs
            - Variables
            - Strings
            - Numbers
            - Comments

       - Variables
            - Variables: Variables names can contain only letters, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. 
            - For instance, 
                - you can call a variable ```message_1``` but not ```1_message```. 
                - ```greeting_message``` is good but ```greeting message``` will cause errors.
                - Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; Python keywords: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list
                - Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
                - Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
            - Note: The Python variables youâ€™re using at this point should be lowercase. You wonâ€™t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have special meanings that weâ€™ll discuss in later chapters.
            - Some Examples: 
            - ![Variable 01](image-4.png)
            - ![variable 02](image-5.png)
            
        - Strings
            - A _string_ is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this:
                - ```"This is a string."```
                - ```'This is also a string.'```
                - This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings 
                - ```'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'```
               - ```"The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."```
               - ```"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."```
               - Some Examples
               - ![string1](image-6.png)
               - ![alt text](image-7.png)

        - Numbers
            - Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games, represents data in visualizations, store information, store information in web application, and so on. Python treats numbers in several different ways, depending on how they're being used. Let's first look at how Python manages integers, because they're simplest to work with

            - Integers
                - You can add (+), subtract (-), multiple (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.
                - Can also handle the power of the number 3**3 = 27
            - Floats
                - Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This team is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appears at any position in a number. Every programming language must be carefully designed to properly manage decimal numbers so numbers behave appropriately no matter where the decimal points appears.
            - Integers and Floats
                - When you divide any numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, you're always get a float:
                - ![alt text](image-17.png)
                - if you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you'll get a float as well:
                - ![alt text](image-16.png)
            - Underscores in Numbers
                - ![alt text](image-18.png)
            - Multiple Assignment
                - You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line. This can help shorten your programs and make then easier to read; you'll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers. For example. here's how you can initialize the variables x,y,and z to zero:
        - Constants
            - A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of the program.Python doesn't have built-in constant types, but Python programers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed
            - ![Constants](image-19.png)
        - Comments
            - In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter.
            - Shortcut for making comments in Jupyter Notebook: Ctrl+/
